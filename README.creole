The fluido-skin is an alternative Maven site skin with rounded corners and code syntax highlight.

Do you want to see how does it look? Check these projects pages:
 * [[http://developers.any23.org/|Any23 developers guide]]
 * [[http://people.apache.org/~simonetripodi|Simone Tripodi at Apache]]

Using it it's quite easy: it is available on Maven central repository and all you need is just add the following XML
snippet in your {{{site.xml}}}:

{{{
<project name="XXXXXXXX">
    ....
    <skin>
        <groupId>org.99soft</groupId>
        <artifactId>fluido-skin</artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
    </skin>
    ....
</project>
}}} 

That's all, have fun with it! :)
